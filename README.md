# Udacity_GenAI_With_AWS_Project

<h2>Domain Expert Model Training Project</h2>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>

Assuming the role of AI engineer, my task is to develop a proof of concept (POC) for a domain expert model using Amazon SageMaker. This model will be trained on a dataset of domain-specific knowledge (medical domain knowledge) and will be capable of generating informative, accurate, and contextually relevant text responses.

<h3>Project Objective
</h3>
<p>The objective of this project is to fine-tune a large language model to become a domain expert, capable of generating text relevant to a specific domain. This model can be utilized to create chat applications, internal knowledge applications, or generate text content for company collateral. </p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<li>Trained Model: A fine-tuned language model proficient in your chosen domain</li>
<li>Report and Presentation: Documentation of your process, challenges, and solution.</li>


<h3>Skills Learnt:</h3>
  <li>Advanced skills in machine learning and natural language processing</li>
  <li>Hands-on experience with AWS tools like Amazon SageMaker</li>
  <li>Insights into domain-specific language model training.</li>
  <li>Practical application of AI in solving real-world business challenges.</li>
